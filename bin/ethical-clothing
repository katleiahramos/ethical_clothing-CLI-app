puts "Keep in mind that clothes made like this takes more money and time to create,so naturally it will cost more. I don't think the goal of this list should be to find retailers that will allow us to keep 'consuming' as quickly as possible just because we can afford to do so. Conversely, I think it should encourage us to purchase when we can or need to, but with as much thought as if we were buying a $300 pair of jeans. "
